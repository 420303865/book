["According to the philosophers of Ancient Greece, the summit of achievement was to have followed the injunction to ‘know yourself.’","While we all have some ideas about who we are, the knowledge we have is often patchy, and we have few opportunities to be guided in reflecting on our personality traits.","This questionnaire does not aim to summarise the whole self, but to suggest a few themes which might be prominent in our characters, with the hope of helping us to live more wisely with the different parts of ourselves."]
