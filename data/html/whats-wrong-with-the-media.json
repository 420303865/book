["We are likely to have grown up thinking that the mainstream media was our friend. The common sense, natural judge of everything that matters and is important and a reliable guide to existence. So why, after spending so long with it, are we generally so overloaded, confused and oddly unfocused on the stuff that really matters?","News organisations claim to be informing us with their bulletins. In fact, more and often than not, they are driving us crazy with needless anxiety and puzzling us with random bits of information we can’t make use of.","Plato said that the world wouldn’t be right until philosophers were kings and kings philosophers. We’d add to this that it won’t be right until philosophers become news journalists and vice versa."]
