["We&#8217;ve grown used to belittling things that don&#8217;t happen to be important to us right now with the powerful term, &#8216;first world problem&#8217;. This kind of tough-minded response is understandable but a bit counterproductive. Just because an issue isn&#8217;t connected to life or death, doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t cause genuine pain or isn&#8217;t worth thinking about. A problem can be important without being life-threatening. Moreover, we should be excited by trying to solve the most advanced problems out there."]
