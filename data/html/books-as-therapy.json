["We have a general sense that books can teach us things, make us value our everyday lives and even shape the way we think. But the question of which books we should read, not just for knowledge or entertainment, but for therapeutic potential, is rarely taken up.","As such, we have have built a microsite to act as a guide to how reading might fit into – and improve – our daily lives. To find out which author might make you become a better lover, or deal with an annoying colleague, visit: www.booksastherapy.com"]
