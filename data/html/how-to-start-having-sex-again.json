["It&#8217;s easy to get stuck in a position of not having much sex. Often we stop trying because of something that goes a bit wrong, perhaps there were some nasty arguments or moments of impotenceÂ or some awkwardness or discomfort. But what&#8217;s worse is that failure in the past puts us off from ever really trying again. We become avoidant or shy around the whole topic and then the situation gets really fraught because a lack of physical contact quickly destroys trust and intimacy.","Impotence has been turned into a major medical problem and diagnosed as a psychological mishap of the first order. But it is also a very intriguing phenomenon that could throw a flattering light on its sufferers."]
